I'm currently trying to make the traditional Tik Tak Toe.
<pre>

// example scenario : 
  
X input : 1
  +-----+-----+-----+ 
  |  X  |  .  |  .  | 
  +-----+-----+-----+ 
  |  .  |  .  |  .  | 
  +-----+-----+-----+ 
  |  .  |  .  |  .  | 
  +-----+-----+-----+ 

0 input : 6 
  +-----+-----+-----+ 
  |  X  |  .  |  .  | 
  +-----+-----+-----+ 
  |  .  |  .  |  .  | 
  +-----+-----+-----+ 
  |  .  |  0  |  .  | 
  +-----+-----+-----+ 

  arr[3][3] = {{"X", ".", "."}
               {".", ".", "."}
               {".", "0", "."}}
</pre>
